        <h2>About the Author</h2>

        <p>
            David and Morgan Schroeder fell in love with surfing in Southern California, riding the 
            magical point breaks of Malibu. When they had their son, Vance—nicknamed 
            “Little Wave”—David naturally became “Big Wave.” Together they read many 
            children's books, but none used groovy surf lingo or captured the vibe they 
            shared — so they wrote their own.
        </p>

        <p>
            David collaborated with artist Mau Rendon to create surf-inspired illustrations 
            full of good vibes and a touch of magic.

            He hopes this book reaches families who care about the ocean, the environment, 
            and nurturing a connection between kids and nature. He wants young readers 
            everywhere to feel stoked about the sea and the world around them.
