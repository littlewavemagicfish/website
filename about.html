        <h2>About the Author</h2>

        <p>
            David Schroeder has a deep passion for surfing and connecting to the natural world.  
            When fatherhood came along surfing and love for the ocean became something he knew 
            he would share with his son, he called "Little Wave".  
        </p>

        <p>
            David collaborated with artist Mau Rendon to create surf-inspired illustrations 
            that show the beauty of the ocean, and its sea creatures in a fun and interacive way.

        </p>

        <p>
            David hopes this book brings smiles to families that care about the ocean, the environment 
            and the positive impact nature can have on all children.
