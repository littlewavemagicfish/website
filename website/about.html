    <h2>About the Author</h2>

    <p>
        David Schroeder fell in love with surfing in Southern California, riding the 
        magical point breaks of Malibu. When he had his first son, Vance, nicknamed 
        “Little Wave,” he became “Big Wave.” Together they read many children's books, 
        but none used groovy surf lingo or reflected the vibe they shared — so they 
        wrote their own.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dave collaborated with artist Mau Rendon to create surf-inspired illustrations 
        full of good vibes and a touch of magic.

    <p>
        Dave hopes this book reaches families who care about the ocean, the environment, 
        and nurturing a connection between kids and nature. He wants young readers 
        everywhere to feel stoked about the sea and the world around them.
